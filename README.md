# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2021 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2021 Advent of Code repository!
This year, my goals are:

1. complete first 10 puzzles
2. collect at least 25 stars

My AoC repositories: [2015](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2015), [2016](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2016), [2017](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2017), [2018](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2018), [2019](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2019), [2020](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2020)

## What I learned, what I still don't know

Legend:

:ambulance: - I don't fully understand either the logic or the implementation - HALP!

:hourglass_flowing_sand: - I think this could or should run faster, but I don't know how to optimize it!

:hammer: - Not completely satisfied with solution, but I know how (and plan to) fix it.
