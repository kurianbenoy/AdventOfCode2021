# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2021 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2021 Advent of Code repository!
This year, my goals are:

1. complete first 10 puzzles
2. collect at least 25 stars

My AoC repositories: [2015](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2015), [2016](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2016), [2017](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2017), [2018](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2018), [2019](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2019), [2020](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2020)

## What I learned, what I still don't know

Legend:

:ambulance: - I don't fully understand either the logic or the implementation - HALP!

:hourglass_flowing_sand: - I think this could or should run faster, but I don't know how to optimize it!

:hammer: - Not completely satisfied with solution, but I know how (and plan to) fix it.

Puzzle | Solution(s) | Remarks |
---    |---    |----
[Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) | [Python](python/01.py) | Here's a [very cringey video](https://youtu.be/-MHDfcas4zo) (in Croatian) of my 6AM thought/solution process. Afterwards I [refactored](https://youtu.be/kGzPefiVyAU) it.. |
[Day 2: Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) | [Python](python/02.py) | [initial solution video](https://youtu.be/nUwS8rRacR4) |
[Day 3: Binary Diagnostic](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) | [Python](python/03.py) | [part 1 solution video](https://youtu.be/gUCD1leNNE8) - part 2 got me so tired that I didn't record it |
[Day 4: Giant Squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) | [Python](python/04.py) | I LOVED THIS PUZZLE. Unfortunately no video because I was not very talkative this morning but might record a walk-through later. WELCOME GIANT SQUID!! |
